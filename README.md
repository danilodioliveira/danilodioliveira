### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Danilo, I have a degree in computer engineering and recently I started to study the data science field. Despite having less than 1 year of experience, I have been increasing my knowledge both in the theoretical and in the practical part, focusing on real business problems.

During this last year (2020) I dedicated myself to some courses to acquire the necessary basis to start my journey, these were:

- Professional Certification in Data Science - IBM
- Data Science Bootcamp - IGTI
- Machine Learning Bootcamp - IGTI

In the year 2021 I intend to complete the Big Data, Data Science and ML course with Google Cloud Platform and Big Query,
by the Data Science Academy, and I will start my MBA in Big Data at FIAP with completion scheduled for 03/2022.

In addition, I am also part of the Meigaron DS Community, where we solve real business case projects every month.
