### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Danilo, IÂ´m a computer engineer and recently I started to study the data science field. I have been increasing my knowledge always balancing theory and practice, focusing on real business problems.

During this last year (2020) I dedicated myself to some things that I considered vital to acquire the necessary basis to start my journey, these were:

- Professional Certification in Data Science - IBM
- Data Science Bootcamp - IGTI
- Machine Learning Bootcamp - IGTI

In the year 2021 I intend to complete: 
- Big Data, Data Science and ML course with Google Cloud Platform and Big Query - Data Science Academy 
- MBA in Big Data - at FIAP with completion scheduled for 03/2022.

In addition, I am also part of the MeigaronÂ´s DS Community, a place where we solve real business case projects every month.
